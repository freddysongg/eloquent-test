# GitHub Branch Protection Configuration - Solo Developer

## Overview

This document provides simplified GitHub branch protection rules optimized for solo development workflow while maintaining essential code quality and security standards. Team-based restrictions and collaborative features have been streamlined.

## Branch Structure

```
main (production)
â”œâ”€â”€ dev (development/staging)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/* (feature branches)
â”œâ”€â”€ hotfix/* (emergency fixes)
â””â”€â”€ release/* (release candidates)
```

## Branch Protection Rules

### ðŸ”’ Main Branch (Production) - Solo Developer

Navigate to: Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Add rule â†’ Branch name pattern: `main`

#### Simplified Settings for Solo Development

**âœ… Require a pull request before merging** (Optional)
- [ ] Require approvals: **0** (solo developer, no reviewers needed)
- [x] Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- [ ] Require review from CODEOWNERS (disabled for solo work)
- [ ] Restrict who can dismiss pull request reviews (not applicable)

**âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging**
- [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Essential status checks (simplified):
  - `backend-ci / backend-ci-summary`
  - `frontend-ci / frontend-ci-summary`
  - `integration-tests / integration-summary`
  - `security / security-summary`

**âœ… Require conversation resolution before merging**
- [x] All conversations must be resolved

- [ ] Disabled for easier solo development workflow

**âœ… Require linear history** (Optional)
- [ ] Allow merge commits for simpler workflow

**âœ… Include administrators**
- [ ] Allow administrators to bypass (solo developer flexibility)

**âœ… Restrict who can push to matching branches**
- [ ] No restrictions (solo developer has full access)

**âœ… Allow force pushes** (Solo Developer)
- [x] Enabled for administrators only (for emergency fixes)

**âœ… Allow deletions**
- [ ] Disabled (protect against accidental deletion)

### ðŸš€ Dev Branch (Development) - Solo Developer

Navigate to: Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Add rule â†’ Branch name pattern: `dev`

#### Simplified Settings for Solo Development

**âœ… Require a pull request before merging** (Optional)
- [ ] Require approvals: **0** (solo developer convenience)
- [x] Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- [ ] Require review from CODEOWNERS (not applicable)

**âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging**

**âœ… Require signed commits**
- [ ] Optional for dev branch

**âœ… Require linear history**
- [ ] Allow merge commits for easier feature integration

**âœ… Include administrators**
- [ ] Administrators can bypass for emergency fixes

- [ ] Disabled

**âœ… Allow deletions**
- [ ] Disabled

### ðŸ”§ Feature Branches

Pattern: `feature/*`

- No protection rules (developers have full control)
- Must create PR to merge into `dev`
- Automatic deletion after merge

### ðŸš¨ Hotfix Branches

Pattern: `hotfix/*`

**âœ… Require a pull request before merging**
- [x] Require approvals: **1** (expedited for emergencies)
- Required status checks (minimal for speed):
  - `backend-ci / test (3.11)`
  - `frontend-ci / test (20.x)`
  - `security / secret-scanning`

## Automated Merge Rules

### Dependabot Auto-merge

Create `.github/auto-merge.yml`:

```yaml
# Auto-merge rules for Dependabot PRs
rules:
  - match:
      dependency_type: "development"
      update_type: "semver:patch"
    actions:
      merge:
        method: squash
        
  - match:
      dependency_type: "production"
      update_type: "security:patch"
    actions:
      merge:
        method: squash
        required_approvals: 1
```

## GitHub Settings Configuration

### General Repository Settings

## Enforcement Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Week 1)
- Create branch structure
- Configure basic protection rules
- Set up team permissions

### Phase 2: Testing Period (Week 2)
- Enable all rules in "warning" mode
- Test workflow with sample PRs
- Adjust rules based on solo development needs

### Phase 3: Full Activation (Week 3+)
- Enable essential protection rules
- Optional: Signed commits (as needed)
- Flexible: Linear history (based on preference)

## Manual Configuration Steps

Since GitHub branch protection cannot be fully automated via API without proper authentication, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   ```
   https://github.com/[your-username]/eloquentai/settings
   ```

2. **Go to Branches Section**
   ```
   Settings â†’ Branches
   ```

3. **Add Protection Rules**
   - Click "Add rule"
   - Enter branch name pattern
   - Configure settings as specified above
   - Click "Create" or "Save changes"

4. **Configure Collaborators (optional)**
   ```
   Settings â†’ Manage access â†’ Invite collaborators
   ```

5. **Set Up Environments**
   ```
   Settings â†’ Environments â†’ New environment
   ```

## CLI Commands for Setup

```bash
# Push dev branch to remote
git push -u origin dev

# Set default branch (optional, can do in GitHub UI)
gh repo edit --default-branch main

# Create branch protection (requires GitHub CLI with appropriate permissions)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["continuous-integration/travis-ci"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":2,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true}' \
  --field restrictions='{"users":[],"teams":["release-managers"]}'
```

## Monitoring and Compliance

### Weekly Review Checklist
- [ ] Review bypass events in audit log
- [ ] Check for stale PRs requiring attention
- [ ] Verify all status checks are functioning
- [ ] Check Dependabot PR queue
- [ ] Review security alerts and vulnerabilities

### Monthly Security Audit
- [ ] Review branch protection settings
- [ ] Rotate API keys and secrets
- [ ] Check for unused deploy keys
- [ ] Review webhook configurations
- [ ] Update dependencies and security patches

## Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process
1. Create `hotfix/*` branch from `main`
2. Apply fix with minimal changes
3. Create PR (self-approval for emergencies)
4. Deploy to staging for validation
5. Fast-track to production after testing

### Break-Glass Procedure
For critical production issues:
1. Solo developer bypasses protection (logged in audit)
2. Direct push to main with immediate documentation
3. Deploy hotfix immediately
4. Post-incident review within 24 hours (self-review)
