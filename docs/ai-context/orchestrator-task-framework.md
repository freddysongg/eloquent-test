**Key Principles**:
- **Evidence-Based Progress**: All tasks require measurable outcomes and validation
- **Parallel Development**: Tasks designed for simultaneous execution across specialists  
- **Quality Gates**: Multi-level validation at task, feature, and phase boundaries
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive identification and resolution strategies
- **Living Documentation**: Framework updates as tasks complete and insights emerge
