assigned_agent: "devops-specialist (aws-cloud-architect)"  
priority: "high"
status: "identified"
current_date: "2025-08-25"

discovered_issue:
  - Staging configuration references `staging-latest` image tag
  - ECR repository only contains `prod-latest` tagged image
  - App Runner attempting to pull non-existent image
  - Configuration files (.env.deployment vs staging.tfvars) have tag mismatches

configuration_inconsistencies:
  staging.tfvars: backend_image_tag = "prod-latest" (recently updated)
  .env.deployment: TF_VAR_backend_image_tag="staging-latest" (outdated)

resolution_required:
  - Align image tagging strategy across all environments

**‚ùå CRITICAL-003: API Gateway Integration Timing Dependencies - ARCHITECTURE ISSUE**
```yaml
title: "API Gateway Integration Failing Due to App Runner Startup Timing"
assigned_agent: "api-gateway-specialist"
priority: "high"  
status: "blocked"
current_date: "2025-08-25"

timing_dependency_issue:
  - API Gateway integration requires operational App Runner service URL
  - App Runner service must be in RUNNING status before API Gateway configuration
  - Current approach attempts integration before service readiness
  - "Invalid HTTP endpoint specified for URI" errors during terraform apply

architectural_considerations:
  - API Gateway integration cannot proceed until backend service is operational
  - Service startup time varies (typically 5-15 minutes for App Runner)
  - Terraform deployment sequence needs proper dependency management
  - Health check validation required before integration configuration

required_solution:
  - Implement proper terraform dependency management between App Runner and API Gateway
  - Add service readiness validation before integration deployment
  - Consider two-phase deployment: infrastructure first, then integrations
  - Implement monitoring and validation loop for service startup

immediate_approach:
  - Monitor App Runner service status until RUNNING
  - Complete API Gateway integration only after service validation
  - Implement health check validation before proceeding

production_impact: "HIGH: API Gateway integration blocked until App Runner service operational, affects end-to-end functionality"
```

#### **üìä Current Infrastructure Status Assessment**

**AWS Resources Status:**
```yaml
infrastructure_components:
  networking:
    status: "‚úÖ OPERATIONAL"
    details: "VPC, subnets, security groups, NAT gateways all healthy"
  
  compute:
    status: "‚ùå FAILED"  
    details: "App Runner service in CREATE_FAILED state, blocking all dependent services"
  
  data_layer:
    status: "‚úÖ OPERATIONAL"
    details: "ElastiCache Redis cluster healthy and accessible"

    details: "IAM roles, security groups, VPC configuration properly implemented"

overall_health: "‚ùå CRITICAL - Core compute service failed"
deployment_readiness: "0% - Must resolve App Runner service before proceeding"
```

**Deployment Bottlenecks:**
1. **Primary Bottleneck**: App Runner service CREATE_FAILED status prevents all progress
2. **Secondary Bottleneck**: Image tag configuration inconsistencies across environments  
3. **Tertiary Bottleneck**: API Gateway integration timing dependencies
4. **Process Bottleneck**: Lack of proper service readiness validation in deployment pipeline

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
```
App Runner Service Resolution ‚Üí API Gateway Integration ‚Üí End-to-End Testing ‚Üí Production Readiness
       ‚¨ÜÔ∏è BLOCKED HERE
```

#### **üéØ Immediate Action Plan - Priority Order**

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 1: App Runner Service Recovery**
1. Delete failed App Runner service
2. Investigate root cause of CREATE_FAILED status  
3. Verify container image availability and architecture
4. Validate environment variable configuration
5. Redeploy with corrected configuration

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 2: Configuration Alignment**
1. Align image tags across .env.deployment and staging.tfvars
2. Update ECR repository with proper staging image
3. Validate terraform variable consistency
4. Test deployment with aligned configuration

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 3: Deployment Process Improvement**
1. Implement service readiness monitoring
2. Add proper terraform dependency management
3. Create two-phase deployment strategy
4. Establish validation checkpoints before integration steps

**Recovery Timeline Estimate:**
- App Runner service resolution: 2-4 hours
- Configuration alignment: 1-2 hours  
- API Gateway integration: 1-3 hours (after App Runner operational)
- Full deployment validation: 2-4 hours

**Success Criteria for Phase 4.4 Resolution:**
- ‚úÖ App Runner service status: RUNNING
- ‚úÖ Service URL accessible and responding to health checks
- ‚úÖ API Gateway integration deployed successfully  
- ‚úÖ End-to-end connectivity validated from frontend to backend
- ‚úÖ All terraform resources properly managed and synchronized

#### **üîß Technical Debt & Process Improvements Needed**

**Deployment Process Enhancements:**
- Implement proper service readiness validation loops
- Add comprehensive pre-deployment configuration validation
- Establish consistent image tagging and promotion workflows
- Create automated rollback procedures for failed deployments

**Monitoring & Observability Gaps:**
- Real-time deployment status monitoring
- Service health check validation before dependent resource creation
- Configuration drift detection between environments
- Automated failure notification and escalation procedures

**Infrastructure Resilience:**
- Multi-environment deployment consistency validation
- Automated configuration synchronization checks
- Service dependency mapping and validation
- Disaster recovery and rollback automation

#### **üö® PHASE 4.4 SUMMARY - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED**

**Current Status**: Multiple critical blockers preventing deployment completion
**Primary Issue**: App Runner service in CREATE_FAILED state  
**Secondary Issues**: Configuration mismatches and timing dependencies
**Impact**: Complete backend service unavailability, blocking all downstream work
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Requires immediate intervention and resolution

**Next Steps**: Focus on App Runner service recovery, then proceed systematically through configuration alignment and API Gateway integration once core service is operational.

**Ready for Resolution**: All infrastructure prerequisites exist, but service-level issues must be resolved before proceeding to Phase 5.
