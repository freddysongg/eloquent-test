```yaml
status_definitions:
  pending: "Task identified but not yet started"
  in_progress: "Actively being worked on"
  blocked: "Waiting on dependency or external factor"
  under_review: "Implementation complete, awaiting validation" 
  completed: "All acceptance criteria met and validated"
  failed: "Implementation attempted but did not meet criteria"
```

### Cross-Agent Communication Patterns

#### Contract Definition Process
1. **Interface Specification**: Define precise input/output contracts
2. **Mock Implementation**: Create test doubles for parallel development
3. **Integration Testing**: Validate real implementations against contracts  
4. **Documentation**: Record contracts in code and documentation
5. **Change Management**: Versioned updates with backward compatibility

#### Dependency Resolution
- **Prerequisite Mapping**: Clear task dependencies documented
- **Parallel Work Streams**: Independent tasks identified and scheduled
- **Integration Points**: Regular synchronization checkpoints
- **Conflict Resolution**: Escalation paths for technical disagreements

## üìö Framework Usage Guidelines

### For Orchestrator Agents
1. **Task Assignment**: Use task templates to create specific, actionable assignments
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Track completion status and validate acceptance criteria
3. **Risk Management**: Proactively identify and mitigate potential issues
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure all quality gates pass before phase transitions
5. **Resource Allocation**: Balance workload across specialist agents

### For Specialist Agents  
1. **Context Understanding**: Review phase goals and integration requirements
2. **Contract Compliance**: Ensure implementations meet defined interfaces
3. **Quality Standards**: Follow project coding standards and best practices
4. **Communication**: Report progress, blockers, and dependencies promptly
5. **Knowledge Sharing**: Document insights and lessons learned

### Framework Maintenance
- **Living Document**: Update tasks and insights as project evolves
- **Retrospectives**: Regular review of what worked and what needs improvement
- **Pattern Refinement**: Evolve task templates based on experience
- **Metrics Analysis**: Use success metrics to optimize future planning
